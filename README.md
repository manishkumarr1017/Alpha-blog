# Alpha-Blog

In AlphaBlog, I've implemented a robust MVC architecture, where a Post model represents blog posts, a PostsController manages CRUD operations, and views provide an intuitive user interface. Creating a new post is simplified using RoR's form helpers, allowing users to seamlessly input content. For editing and deleting posts, AlphaBlog follows RESTful routing principles. The PostsController includes actions like edit and destroy, providing users the ability to modify or remove their posts directly.

Administrator Empowerment:

AlphaBlog introduces user roles, authentication, and authorization. Admins can efficiently manage the system using a dedicated admin dashboard. Administrators have the authority to edit and delete any post, which involves advanced RoR concepts such as nested resources and forms. This ensures that administrators can maintain content quality and relevance.
